# Gesture Delegation Web Standard

This repository is a proposal for a Gesture Delegation API for the WICG. The intent of this proposal is to gather interest in order to graduate to the WICG and collaborate on an API to ship in web browsers.

An [explainer document](explainer.md) is available in the repository and describes the use cases and requirements used to define the API in addition of some optional use cases and requirements that can be discussed with the community. The explainer document also contains a proposed API to kick off the discussion.
